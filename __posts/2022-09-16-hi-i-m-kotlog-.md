Hi there, this is my very first post using Kotlog - my Kotlin CLI playground for streamlining my content creation workflow.

You can visit the [development cli repoistory](https://github.com/tscholze/kotlin-kotlog-cli) or just to use it the [template repository](https://github.com/tscholze/kotlin-kotlog-template).

### Caution
This project is not meant to be used in production or, to be fair, used by any other person than me. I kjust started learning Kotlin and I do not know if the generated source is legal-safe.
