title: 'Kotlog passed its first milestone'

As you may know, I wrote my own little static site generator called [Kotlog](https://github.com/tscholze/kotlin-kotlog-cli) which stands for ***Kot**lin B**log**ging. The role the app should fill is to help me to stream line my content creation flow and first of all, get to know with the Kotlin programming language.

Kotlog is far away from being "production ready" or "feature complete" but I guess it has passed its first Milestone which is "MVP" (most viable product). That means I can use Kotlog to actually blog and there are no open "must have features".

### Lessons learned
* Kotlin is not that bad
* JetBrains IntelliJ is still far better than Xcode in some regards
* Do not over-think user flows
* It is okay to build just something for yourself
* It is okay, to start with a small set of features
* There are friendly people out there who are willing to help beginners in Kotlin

### Implemented features
* Markdown to Html post
* Post to Social Media Image
* Posts to index file
* Posts to feed.json

This all does not mean, that I have no ideas on how to improve Kotlog in the future. Believe me, there are a lot.

### Possible features
* Moving from Kotlin/html templates to Compose for Web or Kobweb
* Adding interative CLI
* Making it &quot;embedable&quot; in other apps
* Adding &quot;add image&quot; support with optimizations reagarding the image file size
* and many more ...
